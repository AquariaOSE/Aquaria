501 [Krotite Armor] [I recovered this ancient battle armor worn by the Krotites, from a secret entrance to the Energy Temple.]
502 [Energy Idol] [A small statuette that burned with the power of the Krotites.]
503 [Tooth] [In the rush of victory, I pulled this large tooth from the Energy God's jaw. I decided to keep it, as a reminder...]
504 [Big Seed] [I discovered a giant seed in my sanctuary. When I brought it home and planted it, it sprouted into a colorful garden.]
505 [Crab Armor] [I fashioned this armor from the shell of the Giant Crab. It would provide me with extra defense when worn.]
506 [Glowing Plant] [Its twin bulbs drew jellyfish up from the deep.]
507 [Mithalas Pot] [This pot never seemed to run out of meat for my kitchen.]
508 [Arnassi Armor] [I won this armor by completing the Arnassi gauntlet in record time. When worn, I could ride seahorses more effectively.]
509 [Odd Container] [The bubbles trapped inside this container amused me.]
510 [Mithalan Banner] [I took a blue banner from Mithalas, to remind me of the time spent in its waters.]
511 [Mithala Doll] [I imagined that this doll belonged to a young girl who had lived in Mithalas long before it was destroyed.]
512 [Walker Baby] [Perhaps one day it would grow up to be as magnificent as the Walkers in the Kelp Forest.]
513 [Seed Bag] [I spread these seeds around the foresty area of my cave. Soon small leafy sprouts appeared.]
514 [Arnassi Statue] [An Arnassi statue I scavenged from the ruins of the civilization.]

516 [Sun Key] [A strange shiny object... I had no idea what it was for, but I decided to keep it.]
517 [Urchin Costume] [A spiny costume fashioned from shells of sea urchins. Creatures that touched it would take damage from its sharp spikes.]
518 [Girl's Costume] [A rather revealing costume...]
519 [Mutant Costume] [Why did they look so much like me...]
520 [Jelly Costume] [I won this costume by defeating King Jellyfish. When worn, it would heal me if my wounds became critical.]
521 [Mithalan Dress] [A ceremonial costume worn by the Princess of Mithalas.]
522 [Anemone Seed] [When planted, this seed sprouted a garden of anemones in my cave.]
523 [Glowing Seed] [When planted, this seed sprouted a garden of glowing plants in my cave.]

525 [King's Skull] [How did he end up in such a terrible place, I wondered?]
526 [Drask's Trident] [This belonged on the end of a Prince's weapon.]
527 [Song Plant Spore] [The spores from the song plant reacted strongly to the Verse.]
528 [Jelly Egg] [An egg from an upside-down jelly.]
529 [Stone Head] [I wondered if this stone's crude face was the product of nature or something else?]
530 [Golden Starfish] [A special starfish infused with Sun's power.]
531 [Black Pearl] [A beautiful black pearl I found hidden away in a deep cave.]
532 [Baby Crib] [This baby's crib brought powerful memories rushing to the surface.]
